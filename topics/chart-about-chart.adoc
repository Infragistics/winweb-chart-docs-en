= About Chart

Charting is used in business to plot figures in a visual way, to portray information about trends that would be difficult to describe verbally or in writing. The Chart control provides a set of charts and a framework for creating charting applications, or adding charting capability to existing data or information-driven applications.

== Chart Types

Chart allows developers to easily set up common types of charts, such as link:chart-column-chart-2d.html[column], link:chart-bar-chart-2d.html[bar], link:chart-line-chart-2d.html[line], and link:chart-pie-chart-2d.html[pie] charts. link:chart-2d-charts.html[2D] and link:chart-3d-charts.html[3D] modes are available for the most common chart types. Additionally, specialized charts such as link:chart-stacked-bar-chart-2d.html[stacked bar], link:chart-stacked-column-chart-2d.html[stacked column], link:chart-scatter-chart.html[scatter], link:chart-bubble-chart-2d.html[2D] and link:chart-bubble-chart-3d.html[3D] bubble, link:chart-heat-map-chart-2d.html[2D] and link:chart-heat-map-chart-3d.html[3D] heat map, link:chart-radar-chart-specific-properties.html[radar], and link:chart-candle-chart.html[candle] (doji) chart types are available.

You can quickly create a chart with the most basic settings, simply by changing the  pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinchart.ultrachart~charttype.html[ChartType]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.shared.styles.charttype.html[ChartType]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.shared.styles.charttype.html[ChartType]"]  property or using the Chart Wizard.

== Graphical Customization

Each chart's appearance can be customized to suit any particular style, or to add emphasis to the chart and better convey a message. The end result is a graphic that catches the attention of your audience and appears more professional.

In addition to standard coloring models which paint the chart using a set or range of colors, the Chart  pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.paintelement.html[PaintElements]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.paintelement.html[PaintElements]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.paintelement.html[PaintElements]"]  framework allows the developer to customize the appearance down to each data item in the chart, with a great range of capabilities and detail.

Additionally, elements such as chart  pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinchart.ultrachart~axis.html[axes]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.ultrawebchart.ultrachart~axis.html[axes]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.ultrawebchart.ultrachart~axis.html[axes]"] , labels, grid lines, titles, and chart text are fully customizable in their appearance and location.

For more information on customizing the appearance of your chart, see link:chart-appearance.html[Appearance].

== Layers Framework

For more advanced and in-depth development, anything is possible in Chart as a result of the " pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.core.layers_namespace.html[Layers]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.core.layers_namespace.html[Layers]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.core.layers_namespace.html[Layers]"] " framework available. Drawing custom shapes on the chart or manipulating existing ones is as simple as implementing an interface ( pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.core.layers.ilayer.html[ILayer]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.core.layers.ilayer.html[ILayer]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.core.layers.ilayer.html[ILayer]"] ) and using the specialized graphics collection (the SceneGraph) that is used to draw the chart.

Alternatively, you can start from scratch and use the Layers framework to draw a completely new type of chart!

For more information on chart layers, see link:chart-layers.html[Layers].
