A link:chart-scatter-chart.html[scatter chart] is used either to show the relationship among the items in several distinct series of data, or to plot two sets of values as one series of x/y coordinates. A scatter chart draws attention to uneven intervals or clusters of data. This type of chart is often used to plot scientific data, and can highlight the deviation of collected data from predicted results.

A link:chart-line-chart-2d.html[line] chart shows trends in changing data values at equal intervals.
