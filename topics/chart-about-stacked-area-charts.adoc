In a stacked 100% area chart, the areas reach a total of 100% of the axis range at each point.

An area chart is a form of line chart, but the area between the horizontal (x) axis and the line connecting the data markers is filled with color. This makes it easy to see where the points encompassed by the different data series overlap.

If you want your chart to display data in chronological order, and plot points across the x-axis according to elapsed time, see link:chart-display-data-on-a-time-scale-axis.html[Display Data on a Time-Scale Axis].
