= Binding to WinDataSource

One of the data sources that you can bind the WinChart™ control is the WinDataSource component. This topic will guide through the steps to bind your chart to WinDataSource.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
To learn how to work with the WinDataSource component, see link:windatasource-using-the-windatasource-designer.html[Using the WinDataSource Designer].
====

Set up your WinDataSource with valid data for the chart type that you want to bind. The screen shot below shows the Data Entry form of the WinDataSource designer, with a sample set of data to which the Chart control can be bound. The example code below demonstrates how to bind Chart to WinDataSource.

.Note
[NOTE]
====
Make sure you change each DataColumns DataType to be of numeric type, otherwise you will get an exception at run time.
