= Creating a Drilldown Chart

Chart drilling is the concept of allowing end users to interact with chart data elements so that the details that compose that data can be shown in a child chart. Chart drilling usually is implemented in such a way so that the end users can click on a chart data element and that will cause the details that compose that element to be fetched and then populated into the same chart. This article will discuss one way of achieving this functionality with the Infragistics WinChart.

The following topics comprise of a multi-part walkthrough that guides you through the process of creating a chart that allows you to drilldown three levels:

*  pick:[win-forms,win-forms-old=" link:chart-creating-a-drilldown-chart-part-1-of-5.html[Creating a Drilldown Chart (Part 1 of 5)]"] 
*  pick:[win-forms,win-forms-old=" link:chart-creating-a-drilldown-chart-part-2-of-5).html[Creating a Drilldown Chart (Part 2 of 5)]"] 
*  pick:[win-forms,win-forms-old=" link:chart-creating-a-drilldown-chart-part-3-of-5.html[Creating a Drilldown Chart (Part 3 of 5)]"] 
*  pick:[win-forms,win-forms-old=" link:chart-creating-a-drilldown-chart-part-4-of-5.html[Creating a Drilldown Chart (Part 4 of 5)]"] 
*  pick:[win-forms,win-forms-old=" link:chart-creating-a-drilldown-chart-part-5-of-5.html[Creating a Drilldown Chart (Part 5 of 5)]"] 

At the end of the multi-part walkthrough, you will have created a chart that allows you to drilldown three levels. The following screen shots display the chart at each level.
