= Customize the Appearance of Lines in Line and Area Charts

Starting in 2006 Volume 3, you can customize the appearance of each line in your 2D line and area charts, so that the data is more representative and informative to your end users. For example, in a line chart that contains three series, you can customize each line so that they are of varying thicknesses, spline tensions, and line styles, as shown in the screen shot below.

The example code below demonstrates how to use the various  pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.lineappearance_properties.html[LineAppearance properties]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.lineappearance_properties.html[LineAppearance properties]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.lineappearance.html[LineAppearance properties]"]  to make the appearance of each line (series) unique. For an overview of line appearances, and a description of each of the properties, see link:chart-line-appearances.html[Line Appearances].
