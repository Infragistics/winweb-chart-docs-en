= Item and Series Labels

In a SetLabelAxis object, data items are grouped into series. Typically when this occurs, a row of data represents a series, and the value in each column for that row represents the items in that series.

Therefore, item labels are printed for each data item (column), and series labels are printed for each group of items (row) on a grouped SetLabelAxis object.
