= Numeric, Set Label, and Date/Time Axes

Each axis is either a "numeric," "set label," or "date/time" axis. A numeric axis is based on a numeric scale, which can be a linear or logarithmic scale. A SetLabelAxis object is a set of evenly-spaced data items, optionally grouped by series or row. A date/time axis is based on a continuous or discrete scale of time.
