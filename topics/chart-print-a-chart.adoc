= Print a Chart

This topic discusses the  pick:[win-forms=" link:infragistics4.win.ultrawinchart.v{ProductVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinchart.ultrachart~printchart.html[PrintChart]"]  method, which is invoked to print a WinChart™.

== Printing a Chart to the Default Windows Printer

The sample code below demonstrates how to print a chart to the default Windows printer:

[start=1]
. Before you start writing any code, you should place using/directives in your code-behind so you don't need to always type out a member's fully qualified name.

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Imports System.Drawing.Printing
----

*In C#:*

----
using System.Drawing.Printing;
----

[start=2]
. Add a command button to the web form containing the chart you wish to print. The user will click this button to initiate the print job.
[start=3]
. Add the following code to the *Click* event handler for the command button:

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub btnPrintChart_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnPrintChart.Click
        Dim printer1 As New System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings()
        Dim page1 As New System.Drawing.Printing.PageSettings()
        Me.UltraChart1.PrintChart(printer1, page1)
End Sub
----

This code assumes that you have included the System.Drawing.Printing reference into your namespace as well as declared a PrinterSettings and PageSettings object in the Form's class.

*In C#:*

----
private void btnPrintChart_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	PrinterSettings printer1 = new PrinterSettings();
	PageSettings page1 = new PageSettings();
	this.ultraChart1.PrintChart(printer1, page1);
}
----

== Printing a Chart to a Specific Printer

You can also print the chart to a specific printer device using specified settings. The sample code below illustrates how to print the chart in landscape orientation to a specific printer on the system named "ColorLaser".

[start=1]
. Add a command button to the web form containing the chart you wish to print. The user will click this button to initiate the print job.
[start=2]
. Add the following code to the Click event handler for the command button:

*In Visual Basic:*

----
Private Sub btnPrintChart_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, _
  ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnPrintChart.Click
        Dim printer1 As New System.Drawing.Printing.PrinterSettings()
        Dim page1 As New System.Drawing.Printing.PageSettings()
        printer1.PrinterName = "ColorLaser"
        page1.Landscape = True
        Me.UltraChart1.PrintChart(printer1, page1)
End Sub
----

This code assumes that you have included the System.Drawing.Printing reference into your namespace as well as declared a PrinterSettings and PageSettings object in the Form's class.

*In C#:*

----
private void btnPrintChart_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
        printer1 = new PrinterSettings();
        page1 = new PageSettings(printer1);
        printer1.PrinterName = "ColorLaser";
        page1.Landscape = true;
        this.ultraChart1.PrintChart(printer1, page1);
}
