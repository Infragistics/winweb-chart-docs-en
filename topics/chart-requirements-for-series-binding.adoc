= Requirements for Series Binding

The table below outlines the number and type of series that each chart type's data set must contain in order to bind to a series object. If any of these requirements are not met, the chart will not render.

For an overview on Chart's series collection, see link:chart-series-collection.html[Series Collection].

.Note
[NOTE]
====
The Column Line and Scatter Line charts do not support link:chart-series-collection.html[series collections]. Instead, use the link:chart-composite-chart.html[Composite chart] with multiple chart layers.
