= Resize a 3D Chart at Design Time

This will explain how to scale a 3D chart to better fit in the display area using the  pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.win.ultrawinchart.ultrachart~transform3d.html[Transform3D]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.ultrawebchart.ultrachart~transform3d.html[Transform3D]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.webui.ultrawebchart.ultrachart~transform3d.html[Transform3D]"]  property at design time. After placing a 3D chart on your form you may want to change the chart to better fit inside of the display. You may also want to rotate the chart to change the viewing angle. In order to quickly accomplish these tasks, use the Transform3D property at design-time via the property pages.

The Transform3D property has four parts. The easiest way to manipulate these is to click the drop-down arrow for the combo box in the Transform 3D area. The drop-down will have several controls for you to use.

[start=1]
. There will be a vertical slider that has an S ( pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.view3dappearance~scale.html[Scale]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.view3dappearance~scale.html[Scale]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.view3dappearance~scale.html[Scale]"] ) below it. Moving the slider up and down or moving the numeric spin up and down for the S (Scale) coordinate makes the size of the chart increase and decrease in both height and width.
[start=2]
. There will be a vertical slider that corresponds to X ( pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.view3dappearance~xrotation.html[X Rotation]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.view3dappearance~xrotation.html[X Rotation]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.view3dappearance~xrotation.html[X Rotation]"] ). Moving this slider up and down or moving the numeric spin up and down for the X (X Rotation) will rotate the chart about the X-Axis.
[start=3]
. There will be a horizontal slider that corresponds to Y ( pick:[win-forms=" link:{ApiPlatform}win.ultrawinchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.view3dappearance~yrotation.html[Y Rotation]"]  pick:[asp-net=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.view3dappearance~yrotation.html[Y Rotation]"]  pick:[aspnet-old=" link:{ApiPlatform}webui.ultrawebchart{ApiVersion}~infragistics.ultrachart.resources.appearance.view3dappearance~yrotation.html[Y Rotation]"] ). Moving this slider left and right or moving the numeric spin up and down for the Y (Y Rotation) will rotate the chart about the Y-Axis.
[start=4]
. There is also a Box in the drop-down. If you move your mouse pointer up and down about the box, the chart will rotate about the X-axis. If you move the pointer left and right about the box, the chart will rotate about the Y-axis. If you move the arrow in diagonal motions it will rotate the chart on both Axes.

Clicking OK commits these changes to your chart. The Transform3D property allows user to change the size of the chart as well as the angle for which the chart will be viewed.
