= WinChart Smart Tag

In Visual Studio 2005 (.NET Framework 2.0), each Infragistics Windows Forms control/component is equipped with a Smart Tag. By simply selecting the control/component, a Smart Tag anchor appears. When you click this anchor, a pop-up panel appears, providing you with quick and easy access to the most common properties and settings of the control/component.

The WinChart™ Smart Tag contains the following sections:

* Actions -- Provides quick access to the Chart Wizard, which allows you to create and configure charts.
* Behavior -- Provides easy access to properties that govern how the control behaves on the form.
* Appearance -- Provides common tasks involving the appearance, look, and feel of the control.

See below for a description of the item (e.g., drop-down list) in each section, as well as the item's corresponding property in the properties grid.
