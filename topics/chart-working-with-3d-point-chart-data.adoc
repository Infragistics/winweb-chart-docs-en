= Working with 3D Point Chart Data

This topic discusses useful information that will help you to ensure that your data is rendered properly in the 3D point chart.

== Data Requirements

While the Chart control allows you to easily point the chart to your own custom data, it is important that you are supplying the appropriate amount and type of data that the chart requires. If the data does not meet the minimum requirements based on the type of chart that you are using, an error will be generated.

The following is a list of data requirements for 3D point charts:

* The data set must contain at least one row and three numeric columns. A numeric column is any DataColumn containing only values that can be interpreted as numbers. If an array or collection is used as the data source, the objects in that array or collection must have at least three public properties which are of a numeric Type.
* If you are binding the 3D Point chart to a series object, see link:chart-requirements-for-series-binding.html[Requirements for Series Binding] for information on the series binding requirements.

== Mapping Data to 3D Point Charts

The chart data is rendered using the following rules:

* The first numeric value will be used as the coordinate on the x-axis.
* The second numeric value will be used as the coordinate on the y-axis.
* The third numeric value will be used as the coordinate on the z-axis.

See below for an example data set, along with the rendered 3D point chart.
