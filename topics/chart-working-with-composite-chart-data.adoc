= Working with Composite Chart Data

Perhaps the trickiest part of setting up a composite chart is fulfilling the various data requirements of each chart layer. For this purpose, refer to the table in the topic, link:chart-series-collection.html[Series Collection]. The table outlines the axis and data requirements for each chart layer, and will be a good reference when creating new composite charts or adding new chart layers to existing composite charts.
